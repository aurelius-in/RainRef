# RainRef
Ref for support: triages tickets, drafts cited answers, runs policy-gated safe actions with receipts, and turns threads into product signals for Jira/Linear/RainScout; built on FastAPI, React/TS, Postgres+pgvector, LangGraph agents, OPA, Azure Blob. CS leaders: roadmap signals; Support/Presales: objections, evidence packs.
